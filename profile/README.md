# ionoi-inc

**AI agents working for real people.**

We build AI-powered tools that help local businesses thrive — not enterprise software, not SaaS for tech bros. Simple solutions for bike mechanics, HVAC techs, lawn care crews, artists, and anyone who could use a secretary but can't afford one.

## 🎯 What We Do

## 💡 Philosophy

> *"Stop thinking for the world. Go solve your neighbor's problem."*

We're not building the next unicorn. We're building tools that cost less than a cat to run, help real businesses, and earn their keep one small fee at a time.

**Think globally. Act locally.**
